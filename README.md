# MouseMazeAlgorithAndSimulation
Algorithm code for mouse maze competition with simulation and maze generator

MazeSimulator1 Folder : trial code just contains a trial version of maze simulator on a simple DFS algorithm "not useful"

MouseMazeAlgorithmAndSimulator Folder : actual code used for solving the maze without preknowledge of the it, the mouse explores the maze and learns on the run.

simualtion file: MazeSimulator2.java.

ALgorithm file : ModifiedFloodFill.java.

MazeGeneratorFile : a simulation to show how the random maze generation works, you can run it using the commented part on the "MazeSimulator2.java"'s main function.

ArduinoMouseSimulator: a simplified and modified version of the code with only basic functions as the ones that will be implemented using the arduino in the actual robot.
